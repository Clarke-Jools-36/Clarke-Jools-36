- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jools Clarke
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation and the internet of things, but not in a gimicky way I promise! I want to create a better way to interact with the internet that
doesnt require being glued to your phone all the time. I also love big data and social media analysis. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently at Cardiff uni studying for my masters in Astrophysics
